# Processing-Falling-Balls
In this project I'm going to use OOP to create some circles that feel gravity force.

UPDATE: 

now you can create as many balls as you want and you can give them in the attribute "breed" the words "carnivoro" (carnivourous) or "erbivoro" (erbivorous), in this way the carnivouros balls will absorb erbivouros balls mass when they get in contact...

The code could be better, someone could create other breeds (like vegetables) and the breed attribute could be substituted with an enum...

now i will stop this project and i will use this results to make a new project about genetic algorithms.
